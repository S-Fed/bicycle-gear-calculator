Easy Bicycle Gear Calculator

This was my school capstone project

What is a Bicycle Gear Calculator?
A bicycle gear calculator allows the user to choose there crank size,cog size, tire size, and variety other options to receive desired outputs such as the gear ratio and average speed.

Why Create a new Bicycle Gear Calculator?
Beginner friendly
Provide suggested gear pairings function
New functions for experienced cyclists 
Help section 
User friendly layout 

Future Plans
The future plans of this program would include cleaning up the graphical user interface, adding a user section and adding more advanced functions.
